2. They should arise from the latest social science literature cited in the description. 

## Environment Setup
1. Provide configuration file(s) preserving dependencies i.e., `environment.yml`, `requirements.txt`, `install.R` (including specific versions).
2. Provide steps/commands to install all dependencies required to run this method.

## Input Data
1. Explain the input data using sample instances as input data in the Git Repository i.e., the features and what they represent. These may be generated samples, staying within data restrictions.
2. Provide links to the actual dataset that the method can work with, idealy [GESIS DBD data](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/digital-behavioral-data).

## Help
1. Remove optional sections that don't apply to your method.
2. Remove "(Optional)" or "(if any)" from the section headings that apply to your method.
3. Some good examples for Python methods are [4TCT: A 4chan Text Collection Tool](https://methodshub.gesis.org/method/4TCT/), [Discovering Themes in Text with Topic Modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)](https://methodshub.gesis.org/method/latent_dirichlet_allocation/) and for R methods [oolong](https://methodshub.gesis.org/method/oolong/)
4. Remove this section as well from the final version.
