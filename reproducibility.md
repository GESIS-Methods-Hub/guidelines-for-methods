## Reproducibility
Specify the resources that the method is using for its working. These may be software packages, linking to live APIs or some pretrained models. In some cases the data on which the resources are built may also be helpful. It is important to provide references to their original work for users to explore further.

Provide a configuration file for your file so that users can alter the bahavior of the method without directly interacting with the code. This may involve, changing the data the method is working on, its parameters e.g., sequence length, whether or not to use padding etc. If offers a clean mechanism for replication and sensitivity tests. 

### Configuration Settings
Provide information on the parameters in the configuration file (ideally in JSON format). The users should be able to understand their purpose, the possible values they can take as input and be able to modify their according to their own use case.

### Random Seed Control
The method must use predefined random seeds to ensure reproducibility of results across executions.

### Requirements and Environment
The environment details must be provided in `requirements.txt`. Running the `pip install` command should ensures all necessary packages are installed.

### Interactive Environment:  
To easily run and explore the method in a pre-configured environment, you can use Binder. It allows you to execute the notebook without needing to set up the environment locally. Click the badge below to get started:

   Povide design images (if needed) to explain the internal working onf the method ![alt {alternate description}]({link to image})

### Hardware Details
Provide hardware and software specifications of the system on which the experiment was executed. Also provide additional information such as time taken/on data size to help users expect the method behavior.

## References (Optional)
Provide references *in APA style* to any publications cited in the method documentation.
