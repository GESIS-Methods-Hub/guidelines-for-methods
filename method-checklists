## 2.1. Checklists for Computer science and Social science methods submission
1.	Openness: Methods Hub Preconditions (Chapter3 in method guidelines)
   
|   | Openness criteria|
|---|------------------|
| ☐ | Open-sourced programming language |
| ☐ | Publicly accessible script |
| ☐ | Open license for reuse | 

2.	Relevance: Method Scope criteria (Chapter 4 in method guidelines)
   
|   | Relevance criteria|
|---|-------------------|
| ☐ | Providing social science use case(s) or citing social science publications |
| ☐ | DBD applicability by citing DBD dataset or mentioning type of DBD data |
| ☐ | Assign the method to appropriate task category(ies) |

3.	Method documentation and code quality (Chapter 5 in method guidelines)
   
|   | Method documentation|
|---|---------------------|
|   | *3.1. Required documents* |
| ☐ | Configuration file to recreate working environment. It can be requirements.txt, install.R, configuration.yml etc.|
