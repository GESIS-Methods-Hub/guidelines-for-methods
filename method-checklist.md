Method repo URL: ______________________________________

For a method to be considered for Methods Hub, it must fulfill checklists 1, 2 and 3.

## checklist 1: Method Submission Preconditions 
(Ref. [Method preconditions guide](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/guidelines-for-methods/blob/main/method-submission-guidelines.md#3-method-preconditions))

|   | Openness criteria|
|---|------------------|
| ☐ | Developed in open-sourced programming language |
| ☐ | Publicly accessible script |
| ☐ | Open license for reuse | 

## checklist 2:	Method Scope i.e., relevance to social science

|   | Relevance criteria|
|---|-------------------|
| ☐ | Providing social science use case(s) or citing social science publications of the method or similar methods |
| ☐ | The method can be applied to Digital Behavioral Data by providing links to data sources and demonstrated through sample data in the repo |
| ☐ | Assign the method fits into the defined task vocabulary for computational methods in social science ([method tasks](For more on [method tasks](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/guidelines-for-methods/blob/main/methods-tasks.md)))|

## checklist 3:	Method documentation and code quality 
(Ref. [Method quality guide](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/guidelines-for-methods/blob/main/method-submission-guidelines.md#5-method-quality-guidelines))

|   | Method documentation|
|---|---------------------|
|   | *3.1. Required documents* |
| ☐ | Configuration file i.e., Requirements.txt, install.R, configuration.yml etc. |
| ☐ | Open license file e.g., MIT open license, Apache 2.0 open license and CC-BY 4.0 etc. |
| ☐ | [Citation File Format (.CFF), CITATION file](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) or alternative for citing method |
| ☐ | README file in [method template](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/guidelines-for-methods/blob/main/method-README-template.md) |
| ☐ | binder/postbuild file [postBuild](https://methodshub.gesis.org/snippet/postBuild) |
| ☐ | *3.2 optional* |
| ☐ | [for preview as GitHub Action](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/preview?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) |

## checklist 4 (Special case): AI/ML Methods with established communities (Consult Methods Hub Team first)
(Ref. [Trusted third parties](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/guidelines-for-methods/blob/methodguide-v2-25.07/method-submission-guidelines.md#12trusted-third-party-review-bodies) and [Established communities](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/guidelines-for-methods/blob/methodguide-v2-25.07/method-submission-guidelines.md#13alternative-for-established-methods))
  
|   | Openness criteria|
|---|------------------|
| ☐ | Satisfies checklist 1 |
| ☐ | Has a tutorial for the method by following the tutorial guides that elaborate on the reuse of the method with a social science use case or research question |
|   | OR |
|   | The method is published by a trusted third party that review code and documentation for their published software (contact Methods Hub Team) |
