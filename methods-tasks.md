Text mining: Text mining involves extracting valuable insights and patterns from unstructured textual data. It includes tasks such as information retrieval, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis. 

Sentiment analysis: Sentiment analysis aims to determine the emotional tone expressed in text data. It is often used to understand public opinion, customer feedback, or social media sentiment. 

Topic modeling: Topic modeling is a technique to identify topics or themes within a collection of documents. It helps in uncovering the main subjects discussed in large datasets. 

Named entity recognition: Named entity recognition involves identifying and classifying entities (such as names of people, organizations, or locations) within text data. 

Text classification: Text classification involves assigning predefined categories or labels to text data. It is commonly used for tasks like spam detection or sentiment categorization. 

Text clustering: Text clustering groups similar data together based on their features. It helps in organizing and understanding large volumes of data. 

Graph mining: Graph mining involves analyzing relationships and patterns within graphs or networks. It is particularly useful for uncovering connections in social networks or organizational structures. 

Data classification: Data classification is the process of assigning predefined labels or categories to data instances. It is a fundamental step in supervised machine learning. 

Data clustering: Data clustering involves grouping similar data points together based on certain characteristics. It is useful for exploring patterns and structures within datasets. 

Data enrichment: Data enrichment involves enhancing existing datasets with additional information from external sources. This process adds valuable context to the data for more comprehensive analysis. 

Large Language Models: Large Language Models are advanced natural language processing models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data. They can be fine-tuned for specific tasks and are powerful tools for language-related analyses. 

Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning is the process of adjusting a pre-trained model to perform specific tasks or cater to domain-specific data. It helps optimize model performance for a particular use case. 

Pretraining: Pretraining involves training a model on a large, general dataset before fine-tuning it for specific tasks. It allows the model to capture broad patterns and knowledge from diverse data sources. 

Prompt engineering: Prompt engineering involves crafting specific queries or instructions (prompts) to elicit desired responses from language models. It is a technique to guide the model's output for specific tasks. 

 

Analysis: The analysis category focuses on examining and interpreting data to derive meaningful conclusions. It includes methods such as social network analysis, spatial analysis, temporal analysis, time-series analysis, pattern recognition, community detection, outlier detection, anomaly detection, and the use of advanced language models. These methods provide insights into relationships, trends, and anomalies within the data 

Social network analysis: Social network analysis examines relationships and interactions within social networks, providing insights into the structure and dynamics of social connections. 

Spatial analysis: Spatial analysis involves studying the geographical distribution of data to uncover patterns or relationships related to location. 

Temporal analysis: Temporal analysis focuses on analyzing data over time to identify trends, patterns, or changes in behavior or phenomena. 

Time-series analysis: Time-series analysis involves studying data collected over regular intervals to understand patterns and trends that unfold over time. 

Pattern recognition: Pattern recognition is the identification of recurring structures or patterns within datasets, aiding in the understanding and interpretation of data. 

Community detection: Community detection involves identifying groups or communities within a network based on the patterns of connections between nodes. 

Outlier detection: Outlier detection aims to identify data points that deviate significantly from the expected or normal behavior within a dataset. 

Anomaly detection: Anomaly detection is the identification of abnormal or unexpected patterns or events within data, signaling potential issues or interesting phenomena.
